## Notes
Tailwind Config: The design relies heavily on standard Tailwind colors (slate, cyan, purple, emerald, red) and utilities.
Animations: The design uses `animate-in`, `fade-in`, `slide-in-from-bottom`, `zoom-in`, `animate-spin`, `animate-ping`, `animate-gradient-x`. These require `tailwindcss-animate` (already in base stack) and potentially some custom keyframes in `index.css` for things like `animate-gradient-x` if not standard.
Fonts: Uses `font-mono` (likely JetBrains Mono or Fira Code based on the aesthetic) and `font-sans` (Inter or DM Sans).
